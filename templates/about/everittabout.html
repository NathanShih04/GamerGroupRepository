<h1>About Everitt</h1>
    </div>
    <p>I am Everitt Cheng, I am an 11th grader at Del Norte High School. I was born in New York and moved to California at the age of 8. My family and I come from Chinese descent, with my family still practicing aspects of Chinese culture consistently. I like playing video games and watching YouTube videos. I especially enjoy learning about modern history on YouTube, and also learn through my friends. I also aspire to learn multiple languages in the future in both coding and actual languages. Using languages I could travel the world someday.
